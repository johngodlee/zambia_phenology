To what extent to species richness and composition affect phenology in miombo woodlands

Hypotheses:

* Species richness leads to a longer growing season and greater overall productivity
* Species richness leads to a slower rate of greening

* The main issue I have is getting EVI time series of suitable spatial resolution. Anything above 50 m resolution is not ideal to correlate with plot level species richness.
	* Sentinel-2?

* What other factors affect phenology:
	* Rainfall - total and seasonality
	* Temperature?
