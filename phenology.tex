\begin{enumerate}
	\item{Seasonal foliage display (leaf phenology) is a key determinant of

\section{Introduction}

Foliage forms the primary interface between the vegetated land surface, the
atmosphere and incoming solar radiation \citep{Gu2003, Penuelas2009}. Seasonal
cycles of foliage production (leaf phenology) play an important role in
regulating global carbon, water and nitrogen cycles \citep{Garonna2016}.
Vegetation indices derived from remote sensing data, used as a proxy for
foliage display (land surface phenology), have been used to constrain estimates
of primary productivity in terrestrial biosphere models \citep{Bloom2016,
Helman2018}, and to characterise the functional response of vegetation to
various climate drivers \citep{Richardson2013}. Previous studies have
identified environmental drivers of land surface phenology \citep{Adole2019,
Guan2014}, but we lack understanding of how the floristic diversity and
structure of the vegetation itself mediates these relationships
\citep{Whitley2017, Pau2011}. 

At continental scale, patterns of land surface phenology can be explained
adequately using only climatic factors, namely precipitation, diurnal
temperature oscillation, and photoperiod \citep{Adole2018b, Adole2019,
Guan2014}, but significant local variation exists within biomes in the timing
of foliage display that cannot be attributed solely to abiotic environment
\citep{Stockli2011}. Additionally, we lack a mechanistic understanding of the
biotic controls on land surface phenology, which hampers our ability to make
informed predictions of change in phenology under global environmental change.
It has been repeatedly suggested that the diversity, composition, and structure
of plant communities plays a role in determining ecosystem response to abiotic
cues driving patterns of land surface phenology \citep{Adole2018a,
Jeganathan2014, Fuller1999}, owing to differences in phenological strategy
among species, but studies on this are lacking \citep{Ma2022}. Indeed, ground
observations find wide variation in temporal patterns of foliage display among
plant communities within a given biome \citep{Seyednasrollah2019}, but this
variation is rarely represented in predictive models of biosphere-atmosphere
exchanges \citep{Scheiter2013, Pavlick2013}.

Across the miombo woodlands of southern Africa, the largest woodland formation
in the region \citep{White1983}, seasonal oscillations in water availability
drive strong seasonal cycles of foliage display \citep{Chidumayo2001,
Dahlin2016}. Within miombo woodlands, the phenomenon of pre-rain green-up,
where trees produce leaves in advance of seasonal rains, serves as a striking
example of phenological response to seasonal rainfall patterns. While pre-rain
green-up requires heavy investment in hydraulic architecture to access deep
groundwater and to produce embolism resistant hydraulic systems, it may provide
competitive benefits, allowing immediate access to early rainfall and the
associated release of soil nutrients prior to grass flushing \citep{Ryan2017,
February2016}. Detarioid species, slower growing with robust leaves, dense
wood, and deep root systems \citep{Zhou2020, Timberlake1993}, frequently
green-up before the rainy season has commenced. They may also retain their
leaves for longer after the end of the rainy season, though the mechanisms of
this behaviour are unclear \citep{Giraldo2011, Kushwaha2011}. Other species may
only begin to produce foliage during the rainy season, creating a dense flush
of low cost leaves during the mid-season peak of growth and dropping their
leaves earlier as soil water content drops towards the end of the rainy season
\citep{Lasky2016}. While species that green-up early gain a competitive
advantage from having fully emerged leaves once the rainy season starts, they
may be forced to prematurely drop their leaves to avoid excess water loss and
maintain a positive carbon balance if seasonal rains occur much later than
normal \citep{Vinya2018}, an occurrence which is becoming more common
\citep{Wainwright2021}. It has been suggested that variation in phenological
strategy among tree species is one mechanism by which increased species
diversity increases resilience to, and maximises productivity in, water-limited
woodland ecosystems \citep{Stan2019, Morellato2016}. 

Variation in seasonal patterns of foliage display affects broader ecosystem
processes. Woodlands with a longer period of foliage display support a greater
diversity and abundance of wildlife, particularly birds, but also browsing
mammals and invertebrates \citep{Cole2015, Araujo2017, Morellato2016,
Ogutu2013}. As climate change reduces rainy season length and increases the
intensity of drought events in African water-limited woodlands \citep{Cook2020,
Gore2019}, woodlands with a diverse tree community may provide refugia for many
animal species \citep{Bale2002}. The period of green-up is a key time for
invertebrate reproduction \citep{Prather2012} and herbivore browsing activity
\citep{Velasque2016, Morellato2016}. Pre-rain green-up provides a valuable
source of moisture and nutrients for browsing herbivores before the rainy
season \citep{Makhado2018}, and can moderate the understorey microclimate,
increasing humidity, reducing UV exposure, moderating diurnal oscillations in
temperature, and reducing ecophysiological stress which otherwise can lead to
increased plant mortality during the dry season. Thus, understanding what
drives variation in seasonal patterns of foliage display in tropical deciduous
woodlands can provide valuable information on their vulnerability to climate
change, and therefore better information to predict their future composition,
extent and function.

In this study we investigate how tree species diversity and structure influence
land surface phenology in seasonally dry tropical woodlands. We focus
specifically on the lag between green-up/senescence and the onset/end of the
rainy season, the magnitude of foliage display within the growing season, and
the overall length of the growing season. We hypothesise that:
(H\textsubscript{1}) sites with greater species diversity will exhibit a longer
growing season due to a higher diversity of phenological strategies;
(H\textsubscript{2}) in sites with greater species diversity the start of the
growing season will occur earlier with respect to the onset of the rainy season
due to an increased likelihood of containing species which can green-up early;
(H\textsubscript{3}) sites with larger trees will have a longer growing season,
as large trees can better access deep groundwater reserves outside of the rainy
season; (H\textsubscript{4}) sites dominated by detarioid species will
experience earlier pre-rain green-up. 

\section{Materials and methods}

\subsection{Plot data}

We used data on tree species diversity and composition from 619 sites surveyed
as part of the Zambian Integrated Land Use Assessment Phase II (ILUA II),
conducted in 2014 \citep{ILUA2016, Pelletier2018}. Field data collection was
sanctioned by the Zambian Forestry Department in the Ministry of Lands and
Natural Resources \citep{ILUA2016}. Each site consisted of four 50$\times$20 m
(0.1 ha) plots positioned in a 500$\times$500 m square around a central point
(\autoref{schematic}), resulting in a total plot area per site of \num{4000}
m\textsuperscript{2}. The original assessment contained 993 sites, which was
filtered in order to define study bounds and to ensure data quality. Only sites
with $\geq$50 stems ha\textsuperscript{-1} $\geq$10 cm DBH (Diameter at Breast
Height) were included in the analysis, to ensure all sites represented
woodlands with a relatively continuous canopy rather than open `grassy
savanna', which is considered a separate biome with different species
composition and ecosystem processes governing phenology \citep{Morellato2013,
Keith2020}. 

Plots in the ILUA II dataset sampled stems $\geq$10 cm DBH across the area of
the whole plot, while stems <10 cm DBH were only measured within a 20$\times$10
m (0.02 ha) nested subplot. We chose to use only stem measurements $\geq$10 cm
DBH in this study, discarding measurements from the nested subplots. In
woodland ecosystems with a relatively continuous canopy like those studied
here, only the larger trees form the overstorey layer, with smaller trees
existing within the understorey layer \citep{Chidumayo2001}. The signal from
remotely-sensed measurements of land surface phenology is dominated by these
larger trees which form the woodland canopy. We therefore reasoned that small
stems would not be an important factor in determining measurements of land
surface phenology. To further demonstrate the dominance of larger stems in our
sites, we compared the per hectare basal area contribution of stems $\geq$10 cm
with that of stems <10 cm DBH. We found that across all sites, the minimum
proportional basal area contributed by stems $\geq$10 cm was 72\%, while the
median was 98\%.

Sites with non-native tree species, e.g. \textit{Pinus} spp. and
\textit{Eucalyptus} spp. were excluded, as these species may exhibit patterns
of foliage display which differ markedly from that of native tree species
assemblages \citep{Broadhead2003}. Of the \num{49656} trees recorded, 97.9\%
were identified to species. Sites with >20\% of trees not identified to species
were discarded.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{schematic}
	\caption{Schematic diagram of plot layout within a site. Each 50$\times$20
		m (0.1 ha) plot is shaded grey. Note that the plot dimensions are not to
		scale.}
	\label{schematic}
\end{figure}

Within each plot, the species and basal area of all trees with at least one
stem $\geq$10 cm DBH were recorded. Plot data were aggregated to the site level
for all analyses to avoid pseudo-replication. Each site spans an area
500$\times$500 m (0.25 km\textsuperscript{2}), matching that of the land
surface phenology data. We excluded sites where plots differed appreciably in
vegetation composition, to ensure that all sites used in statistical analysis
were representative of the vegetation within the total 0.25
km\textsuperscript{2} area of each site. Using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity
index on species basal area data \citep{Faith1987}, we calculated the mean
pairwise compositional distance between plots within each site. Sites were
discarded when the mean pairwise compositional distance among plots within the
site was greater than the mean pairwise compositional distance of all plots
across all sites. This resulted in a final dataset of 619 sites.

\subsection{Vegetation composition and diversity} 

To describe variation in tree species composition across sites we used
agglomerative hierarchical clustering on species basal area data
\citep{Kreft2010, Fayolle2014} to assign sites to vegetation types. We excluded
species with fewer than five records across all sites from this analysis, as
very rare species can hinder meaningful cluster delineation. We used Ward's
algorithm to define clusters \citep{Murtagh2014}, based on the Bray-Curtis
distance between pairs of sites. We determined the optimal number of clusters
by maximising the mean silhouette width among clusters \citep{Rousseeuw1987}.
We described the vegetation types represented by each cluster using
Dufr\^{e}ne-Legendre indicator species analysis \citep{Dufrene1997}, which
ranks species as the product of their relative frequency and their relative
average abundance in each vegetation type. \Numberstringnum{4} vegetation types
were identified during hierarchical clustering. The mean silhouette value of
the clustering algorithm was 0.64. 

There was some spatial and climatic stratification in vegetation composition
(\autoref{site_map}). Three miombo woodland types were identified, each with
different sets of secondary species, but all dominated by detarioid species
such as \textit{Brachystegia} spp. and \textit{Julbernardia} spp.
(\autoref{clust_summ}). Uapaca miombo is largely absent from the southwest of
the country, occurring predominantly in higher rainfall regions to the north
and east (\autoref{box_facet_map_mat}). Cryptosepalum miombo is found more in
the southwest of the country, possibly representing the drier ``Angolan miombo
woodlands'' described by \citet{White1983}. While Cryptosepalum miombo
woodlands include \textit{Cryptosepalum exfoliatum} as a secondary species,
they should not be confused with Zambezian evergreen forests, which are
dominated by Cryptosepalum \citep{White1983}. Julbernardia miombo is common in
cooler areas and is more climatically restricted than the other miombo woodland
types. Combretaceae woodlands match the description of small stature Zambezian
woodlands, as described by \citet{Dinerstein2017} and \citet{Chidumayo2001}.
These woodlands are not dominated by the same archetypal detarioid tree species
as the other miombo woodland vegetation types. Combretaceae woodlands occur
over a wide climatic range, and contain some of the warmest sites in our
dataset in the southeast of the country. Median species richness and the range
of species richness values per site is similar across vegetation types
(\autoref{clust_summ}).

To describe species diversity in each site, we calculated the Shannon-Wiener
index ($H'$) from species basal area rather than individual abundance, as a
measure of species diversity effectively weighted by species' contribution to
canopy occupancy and thus the land surface phenological signal. $H'$ was
transformed to the first-order numbers-equivalent of $H'$ ($^1\!D = e^{H'}$),
which gives the equivalent number of equally common species that would result
in a given value of $H'$, also known as effective species richness
\citep{Jost2007}. We use $^1\!D$ as the primary measure of species diversity in
our statistical models, and is subsequently referred to as species diversity.
To describe the abundance of Detarioideae species we calculated their
proportional basal area. To describe average tree size, we calculated the
quadratic mean of stem diameters per site. Quadratic mean diameter is exactly
related to site basal area, unlike the arithmetic mean of diameter, and assigns
greater weight to larger trees \citep{Curtis2000}. It is thus a more
appropriate descriptor of average stem size for this study, where the
arithmetic mean would be biased by an abundance of small stems, despite their
small contribution to overall canopy land surface phenological signal. 

\subsection{Remote sensing data}

Precipitation time series data for each site was compiled from the GPM IMERG
Final Precipitation L3 1 day V06 product, which has a pixel size of
0.1\textdegree (11.1 km at the equator) \citep{IMERG}. We used all available
data from 2001 to 2021. There is no clear consensus on best practice for
defining the limits of the rainy season \citep{Guan2014}. Here we followed the
example of \citet{Stern1981} and \citet{Adole2018b}, variations of which have
been used in other studies of African savanna-woodland phenology
\citep{Mupangwa2011, Segele2005}. First, we determined the temporal bounds of
each wet-dry season cycle within our study period of 2001 to 2021 for each site
according to \citet{Ferijal2022}, as the 14 day period with the lowest
precipitation in each calendar year. Where multiple 14 day periods tied for
lowest precipitation within a single calendar year, the later period was
chosen. 

The onset of the rainy season for each wet-dry season cycle was defined as the
start of the first period of 10 days with more than 20 mm total rainfall,
immediately followed by 20 days with more than 30 mm total rainfall
\citep{Tadross2005}. With this rolling window approach we sought to identify
the first sustained period where plant available soil moisture was increasing,
i.e. where the average regional evaporation rate of \textasciitilde{}1 mm per
day was exceeded by rainfall \citep{Campbell1996}, while accounting for the
stochastic nature of rainfall in our study at the start of the rainy season. We
chose to relax the rainfall constraint from 2 mm d\textsuperscript{-1} in the
first 10 day period, to 1.5 mm d\textsuperscript{-1} for the subsequent 20 day
period, to account for variation in the temporal consistency of rainfall at the
start of the rainy season in our study region. As opposed to a percentile of
cumulative rainfall approach, our method is not affected by dry season
storm-burst rainfall events, which, while contributing to overall cumulative
rainfall, often do not generally have the capacity to initiate tree foliage
production due to their transience \citep{February2016}. 

The end of the rainy season was defined as the start of the first period where
fewer than \numberstringnum{4} days within a 30 day period received more than
0.5 mm rainfall. \citet{Guan2014} compares other methods of estimating rainy
season onset and end dates, and finds little functional difference between the
method chosen here and other common methods. To validate our delimitation of
the rainy season we checked that all season start and end dates occurred within
10 days of the dates where 10\% and 95\% of yearly cumulative rainfall were
surpassed, respectively \citep{Adole2018b}. 

To quantify seasonal patterns of leaf display at each site, we used the MODIS
MCD12Q2 v6.1 land surface phenology product \citep{MCD12Q2}. MCD12Q2 provides
annual metrics describing land surface phenology, with a spatial resolution of
\textasciitilde{}500 m. The phenological metrics in MCD12Q2 are derived from
the 2-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) time series (1-2 day
temporal resolution). The MCD12Q2 EVI2 time series is calculated from MODIS
Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted
Reflectance (NBAR), which removes view angle effects. There are a number of
land surface phenology products derived from MODIS vegetation indices. MCD12Q2
was chosen here as it has been used effectively in other studies in deciduous
African woodlands to define the growing season \citep{Begue2014, Adole2018a}.
Additionally, a previous comparison of MODIS-derived land surface phenology
products showed that MCD12Q2 out-performed other products in predicting the
start of the growing season in relation to ground observations
\citep{Peng2017}. 

All sites were determined to have a single annual growing season according to
the MCD12Q2 ``NumCycles'' metric. We used all years of data from 2001 to 2021.
We used the ``Greenup'' and ``Dormancy'' metrics to define the growing season
as the period when the EVI time series exceeds 15\% of the EVI amplitude for a
given growing season (\autoref{ts_illus}). We used the ``Maturity'' and
``Senescence'' metrics, defined as the dates bounding the period where the EVI
time series exceeds 90\% of the EVI amplitude, to define the end of the
green-up period and the start of the senescence period, respectively. We used
these dates to calculate the length of the green-up period and senescence
period. We calculated ``pre-rain green-up'' as the number of days between the
onset of the growing season and the onset of the rainy season, for each year of
available data. Similarly we calculated ``senescence lag'' as the number of
days between the end of the rainy season and the end of the growing season. To
aid interpretation of statistical models, we reversed the sign of the pre-rain
green-up measurements, so that larger values indicate earlier pre-rain
green-up. As senescence generally occurred after the end of the rainy season,
we did not reverse the sign of senescence lag, so larger values indicate later
senescence. 

Daily total precipitation from the GPM IMERG product was separated into three
periods of relevance to different phenological metrics: precipitation during
the growing season, precipitation in the 30 day period before the onset of the
growing season (pre-green-up precipitation), and precipitation in the 30 day
period before the onset of senescence at the end of the growing season
(pre-senescence precipitation) (\autoref{ts_illus}). 

Temperature time series data for each site was compiled from the ERA5-Land
hourly data, using the 2 m air temperature variable at 0.1\textdegree (11.1 km
at the equator) \citep{ERA5}. We aggregated these data to the maximum
temperature for each day over the period 2001 to 2021. We then calculated
cumulative temperature (degree days) during the 30 day pre-green-up period, 30
day pre-senescence period, and the growing season period, as with the
precipitation data. Cumulative temperature has been shown in previous studies
to be an important cue driving patterns of leaf display in more temperate
systems \citep{Archibald2007, Michelson2017, Escamilla2020}. While the spatial
scales of the climate data (0.1\textdegree{}) and land surface phenology data
(500 m) do not match we believe this does not present a problem for our
analyses. Firstly, because temperature and rainfall data are expressed in our
analyses as cumulative values across longer time periods, for example
cumulative rainfall over the 30 days prior to green-up, we do not expect
systematic spatial variation in these aggregated values within each
0.1\textdegree{} pixel, especially when considering multiple years of data.
Secondly, the distance among sites is much greater than the resolution of the
climate data. Any variation in temperature or rainfall within pixels is likely
to be less than that among sites.

\subsubsection{Statistical modelling}

Linear mixed effects models were used to investigate the effect of tree species
diversity (effective number of species), species composition (relative
abundance of detarioid species), and woodland structure (quadratic mean of stem
diameter) on each of the six phenological metrics (cumulative EVI, season
length, length of green-up period, length of senescence period, pre-rain
green-up, senescence lag). We specified a maximal model structure including the
fixed effects of species diversity, quadratic mean of stem diameter, relative
abundance of detarioid species, precipitation and cumulative temperature, the
latter two of which have been shown by previous studies to strongly influence
patterns of foliage display, including green-up and senescence
\citep{Whitecross2017, Adole2019}. For models of growing season length and
cumulative EVI we used cumulative rainy season precipitation and temperature;
for pre-rain green-up and length of green-up period we used cumulative
pre-green-up precipitation and temperature; for senescence lag and length of
senescence period we used cumulative pre-senescence precipitation and
temperature. All models included a random intercept term for site to account
for yearly repeated measurements of site land surface phenology. Fixed effects
in each model were standardised to Z-scores prior to modelling to allow
comparison of slope coefficients within models. 

To determine the magnitude and direction of each fixed effect on each
phenological metric, we compared standardised effect sizes extracted from
models re-estimated using Maximum Likelihood. For each fixed effect we
calculated the 95\% confidence interval of the effect size as 1.96$\times{}$
the standard error of the parameter estimate \citep{Zuur2010}. All statistical
analyses were conducted in R version 4.0.2 \citep{R2020}.

\section{Results}

The majority of sites experienced pre-rain green-up, with the site mean date of
green-up occurring in advance of the mean onset of the rainy season in 498/619
sites. Across all sites, the mean lag between green-up and the onset of
seasonal rains was 14$\pm$20.2 days ($\pm{}$1 standard deviation). Linear mixed
effects models effectively explained 
pre-rain green-up (R\textsuperscript{2}\textsubscript{m}=0.45,
R\textsuperscript{2}\textsubscript{c}=0.65), 
cumulative EVI (R\textsuperscript{2}\textsubscript{m}=0.21,
R\textsuperscript{2}\textsubscript{c}=0.72), 
green-up length (R\textsuperscript{2}\textsubscript{m}=0.20,
R\textsuperscript{2}\textsubscript{c}=0.38) and 
season length (R\textsuperscript{2}\textsubscript{m}=0.14,
R\textsuperscript{2}\textsubscript{c}=0.63), while 
senescence length (R\textsuperscript{2}\textsubscript{m}=0.01,
R\textsuperscript{2}\textsubscript{c}=0.20) and 
senescence lag (R\textsuperscript{2}\textsubscript{m}=0.03,
R\textsuperscript{2}\textsubscript{c}=0.30), were poorly explained. Fixed
effects accounted the majority of total variance explained in models for
pre-rain green-up, season length and green-up length, while the random effect
of site explained most of the variance in cumulative EVI (\autoref{modtab}).

We compared standardised fixed effect sizes for each phenological metric to
determine the strength and direction of their influence (\autoref{mod_slopes}).
Tree species diversity exhibited positive effects on season length
($\beta$=4.7$\pm$0.70, standardised coefficient $\pm$ standard error)
(H\textsubscript{1}) and pre-rain green-up ($\beta$=1.0$\pm$0.39)
(H\textsubscript{2}). Average tree size, measured by the quadratic mean of stem
diameter per site, was a significant predictor of pre-rain green-up
($\beta$=2.0$\pm$0.38) and green-up length ($\beta$=1.0$\pm$0.33), associated
with early pre-rain green-up and a longer green-up period (H\textsubscript{3}).
Sites with larger trees also experienced later senescence
($\beta$=-2.4$\pm$0.40). The proportional basal area of detarioid species was a
significant predictor of pre-rain green-up ($\beta$=1.0$\pm$0.40), and season
length ($\beta$=1.7$\pm$0.71) (H\textsubscript{4}).

\section{Discussion}

We have demonstrated clear effects of tree species diversity, composition and
structure on various metrics of land surface phenology in seasonally dry
tropical woodlands across Zambia. Both tree species diversity and the
proportional basal area of trees from the Detarioideae (subfamily of Fabaceae),
were associated with a longer growing season and with earlier pre-rain
green-up. Our models partition the effects of species diversity and detarioid
relative abundance, suggesting that while some of the positive species
diversity effect is due to niche complementarity, i.e. a true diversity effect,
some is due to the increased likelihood of containing species able to green-up
earlier, i.e. a mass-ratio effect \citep{Grime1998, Tilman2014}. Our study
lends support for a general positive effect of tree species diversity on
ecosystem function in southern African seasonally dry tropical woodlands,
measured through leaf display \citep{Richardson2009}, which aligns with other
recent studies in the region \citep{Godlee2021, McNicol2018, Shirima2015}. Our
results highlight the important role of detarioid species in southern African
woodland function we show that increasing abundance of these species
increases both early season productivity and overall growing season length.

The basal area of detarioid species had a positive effect on pre-rain green-up.
Our results suggest a mass-ratio effect in the pre-rain green-up of Zambian
deciduous woodlands \citep{Grime1998}, whereby a dominant functional group of
trees with particular traits and life history strategy is able to green-up in
advance of seasonal rains and drive longer growing seasons. Given their
tendency to create deep root networks which provide effective water and
non-structural carbohydrate storage \citep{Zhou2020, Timberlake1993}, and their
high wood density which confers embolism-resistance to the tree hydraulic
system \citep{Hoffmann2011, Hacke2001, Chave2009}, we suggest that compared to
other co-occurring taxonomic groups, detarioid species are better equipped to
green-up before seasonal rainfall begins \citep{Vinya2018}. In our analysis we
accounted for the effect of tree size on pre-rain green-up, which generally
correlates with rooting depth, and still found an effect of detarioid abundance
on pre-rain green-up, implying a true effect of detarioid species not linked to
tree size. While pre-rain green-up is a risky strategy, it may provide a
competitive advantage for detarioid species, allowing them to take advantage of
early rainfall and associated soil nutrient release \citep{February2016}.

While at present the ability to green-up prior to the rainy season provides a
competitive advantage to detarioid species by extending the period of
productivity, it is unclear whether this behaviour will continue to provide a
benefit under a changing climate, where the timing of the rainy season is
expected to shift, becoming more erratic and shorter overall
\citep{Shongwe2011, Pohl2017, Wainwright2021}. Given the dominance of detarioid
species in miombo woodlands across southern Africa, decreased productivity of
this group due to a mismatch between leaf display and seasonal rainfall may
affect the future composition, structure and functioning of these woodlands,
potentially leading to a shorter stature, lower biomass and lower productivity
ecosystem.

Environmental variables had consistently strong effects on phenological
metrics, and confirm previous research. Greater rainfall within the rainy
season led to a longer growing season and greater cumulative EVI, matching our
expectations that increased water availability allows for greater foliage
production and builds groundwater reserves allowing for a longer growing season
\citep{Adole2018b}. Surprisingly, greater rainfall in the 30 days leading up to
the start of the growing season was associated with later green-up with respect
to the onset of the rainy season. We suggest this may be the result of large
amounts of rainfall kick-starting foliage production in the absence of a
pre-rain green-up effect in some sites, and may represent cases where grasses
drive the start of growing season land surface phenology signal. This inability
to discriminate between the grassy component and the tree canopy component of
the phenological signal highlights one of the principle drawbacks with
space-borne land surface phenology to characterise patterns of vegetation leaf
display \citep{Archibald2007}. Hotter days were associated with shorter periods
of senescence and green-up, but ultimately a longer growing season and greater
overall productivity. In the case of green-up length, this effect may imply a
temperature trigger on leaf display, as is seen in temperate woodland
ecosystems \citep{Flynn2018}. In the case of senescence, hotter days at the end
of the growing season are expected to increase photorespiration and ultimately
result in a negative leaf carbon balance, triggering leaf loss
\citep{Warren2011, Marin2019}. This study provides a glimpse into how climate
change, particularly warming \citep{IPCC} and increased rainfall seasonality
\citep{Wainwright2021}, could affect leaf phenology in the future in southern
Africa. Future temperature increases in miombo woodlands, particularly high
temperatures at the start and end of the rainy season, could accelerate
green-up and senescence processes. Similarly, a reduction in precipitation
during the growing season could reduce growing season length and overall
productivity. Future studies could explore further how extreme climate events, rather than long-term climate averages as studied here, affect land surface
phenology, ideally in combination with measurements of species composition and
ecosystem structure, which this study has shown are important determinants of
ecosystem function. 

The end of the growing season came later with respect to the end of the rainy
season in plots with larger mean stem diameter, though our model had low
explanatory power. \citet{Cho2017} found that tree cover, measured by MODIS
Leaf Area Index (LAI) data, had a significant positive effect on end of growing
season date in tropical dry woodlands in South Africa. Similarly,
\citet{Guan2014} found at continental scale across Africa that the end of the
growing season came later with respect to the end of the rainy season in areas
where tree cover was higher. Both these previous studies posit that the
observed effect of tree cover on end of growing season date might indicate the
presence of larger trees capable of accessing deeper groundwater reserves or
holding stem-water reserves after the rainy season ends and surface soil
moisture is depleted. Our study lends further support for this suggestion by
directly testing the effect of tree size, rather than tree cover. 

Our best models predicting the length of the senescence period and the end of
growing season lag did not explain much of the variance in these phenological
metrics. Short term oscillations in soil moisture driven by localised rainfall
events, and the condition of ground cover vegetation may be responsible for
driving the length of the senescence period, hence the wide spatio-temporal
variability of this phenological metric and the poor fit of our statistical
models. Most of the variance explained by our models of senescence period
length and senescence lag came from the random effect of site, implying some
unmeasured inter-site variation. Grass productivity is more reactive to
short-term changes in soil moisture than tree activity, and may oscillate
within the senescence period \citep{Archibald2007}. This may explain the lack
of a strong growing season precipitation or tree diversity signal for
senescence lag and length of the senescence period in our models.

Other studies, both globally and within southern African woodlands, have
largely ignored patterns of senescence, instead focussing on patterns of
green-up \citep{Gallinat2015}. Most commonly, studies of senescence simply
correlate the decline of rainfall with senescence \citep{Stevens2016,
Guan2014}, but our best model suggests that temperature is a stronger
determinant of the end of the growing season than precipitation. We suggest
that hotter days at the end of the growing season might accelerate senescence
through tissue damage and embolism \citep{Cho2017}, resulting in a shorter
period of senescence. In temperate ecosystems, which experience autumn
senescence, lower night time temperatures have been shown to increase the rate
of senescence and thus decrease senescence period length \citep{Michelson2017,
Escamilla2020}. In these water-limited and hot systems however, it seems hotter
temperatures are the main driver of senescence. Hotter days appear to delay the
onset of senescence with respect to the end of the rainy season, and higher
temperatures across the growing season were associated with a longer growing
season. Thus, while climate warming could accelerate the process of senescence,
it may also delay the senescence period with respect to the end of the rainy
season.

Alternatively, \citet{Zani2020} suggests that in resource-limited environments,
senescence times may largely be set by preceding photosynthetic activity and
sink-limitations on growth. For example, limited nutrient supply may prohibit
photosynthesis late in the season if the preceding photosynthetic activity has
depleted that supply. \citet{Reich1992} suggested that there are many direct
constraints on leaf life-span such as drought and herbivory, especially in the
seasonally dry tropics, which would lead to timing of senescence being set
largely by the time of bud-burst. Our study indirectly corroborates this
theory, with the finding of a moderate negative correlation between pre-rain
green-up and senescence lag across all vegetation types indicating that later
green-up allows later senescence (\autoref{phen_bivar}).

We found positive effects of tree size (site quadratic mean diameter) on
pre-rain green-up and green-up length, but negative effects on senescence lag.
Our results agree with previous studies that the increased rooting depth of
large trees allows them to access deep ground-water reserves, conferring
resilience to inter-annual variation in patterns of seasonal rainfall
\citep{Holdo2017}. While detarioid species in these woodlands tend to grow to
large sizes, our result of a significant effect of tree size alongside an
effect of detarioid abundance on pre-rain green-up infers particular traits
beyond tree size in the detarioid species that drive pre-rain green-up.

Our finding that species diversity increases growing season length and
cumulative EVI in seasonally dry tropical woodlands provides an example of a
mechanism by which species diversity increases ecosystem function, a pattern
observed previously in other studies of southern African woodlands
\citep{Godlee2021, McNicol2018, Shirima2015}, and globally in other biomes
\citep{Plas2019, Tilman2014}. Our findings provide earth system modellers with
an insight to better understand how changes in the inter-related variables of
species diversity, composition and structure affect one measure of ecosystem
function (land surface phenology). Future studies should aim to disentangle
these effects further, possibly in an experimental context. Incorporating
predictions of biotic composition and its change over time into earth system
models has been limited until recently for two main reasons. Firstly, there are
large uncertainties in the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem function, e.g.
gross primary productivity (GPP) \citep{Ahlstrom2015}. Secondly, until recently
there has been a major paucity of ground data on community composition, and a
lack of appropriate remote-sensing data to scale up to larger areas
\citep{Bodegom2011}. Our study comes at a pertinent time where plot-based
vegetation monitoring networks are now sufficiently widespread to robustly test
hypotheses and generate theory related to the effects of community composition
on ecosystem function across environmental gradients \citep{ForestPlotsnet2021,
SEOSAW2020}. Additionally, recent advances in remote sensing of functional
diversity from hyper-spectral data, combined with the imminent deployment of
space-borne imaging spectrometers by multiple space agencies
\citep{CawseNicholson2021, Rast2021}, will soon allow community composition to
be mapped at large spatial scales \citep{Wallis2024, Cavendar2020} and utilised
by earth system modellers. Our study serves as an example of the kinds of
advancements in ecological understanding relevant to earth system modelling
that can be made by integrating abundant ground data and remote sensing data.

\section{Conclusion}

We explored how tree species diversity, composition and structure of seasonally
dry tropical woodlands influence land surface phenology across Zambia. We
showed that species diversity drives longer growing seasons and promotes
earlier pre-rain green-up across woodlands in the miombo ecoregion. The
abundance of Detarioideae species (subfamily of Fabaceae) had a positive effect
on pre-rain green-up and growing season length, supporting suggestions from
previous studies of their important role in driving pre-rain green-up in
southern African miombo woodlands. Finally, we found that larger trees drive
earlier pre-rain green-up supporting previous research suggesting that deep
roots and persistent carbohydrate storage allows for precocious leaf display.

Our results lend further support to an already well established corpus of study
on the positive effect of species diversity on ecosystem function.
Additionally, our results provide evidence for earth-system modellers,
demonstrating the importance of structure and diversity in determining patterns
of land surface phenology. As reliable data on ecosystem structure,
particularly tree size, become available across larger spatial scales and at
higher spatial resolution, we hope that these data can be explored in models of
land-atmosphere mass and energy exchange to improve their predictive skill
under a changing climate.
